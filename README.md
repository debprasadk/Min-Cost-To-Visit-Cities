# Min-Cost-To-Visit-Cities
Suppose a one-way monorail route comprises n halts. In the said route, starting and ending points
are demarcated as halt 0 and halt n âˆ’ 1, respectively. The costs of travel between every pair of halts
are provided to you in real values. Find the minimal travel cost in the entire route between the
starting and ending points. Note that, taking intermediate halts might save the cost of travel.
